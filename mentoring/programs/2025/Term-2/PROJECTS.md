### Certifier Framework

#### Expanding Platform and Application Opportunities

- Description: This project will add new useful sample applications to the Certifier Framework including a secure messaging app and several key management applications. In addition, we plan to support more platforms, including client platforms like RISC-V, ARM, Raspberry Pi based implementations and potentially a "soft" platform like Android (which is not an "official" Confidential Computing platform but a simulated environment useful for interacting with "real" Confidential Computing platforms).
- Expected Outcome:  The forgoing applications (using the certifier framework), some additional "shims" to support other programming environments like Java and additional support for new platforms.
- Recommended Skills:  Systems programming experience with Linux, and Raspberry Pi. Knowledge of Android programming environment a plus. System security background will be useful.
