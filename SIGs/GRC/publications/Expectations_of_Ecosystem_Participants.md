# Expectations of Ecosystem Participants

# Context

In any environment employing Confidential Computing, there are several distinct classes of participants, and their relationships are generally the same across all such environments.

# Problem

This pattern sets out to list in one place the high-level requirements that various participants in the Confidential Computing ecosystem are likely to place on each other from the governance perspective.

# Solution
