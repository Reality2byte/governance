**Confidential Computing Summit**

* Raluca Ada Popa presented plans for the Confidential Computing Summit, June 29th, 2023 at the Marriott Marquis San Francisco
  * In-person and virtual event
  * Attendees are expected to be users, technologists and regulators, not only developers
  * Coincides with final sessions of the Data+AI Summit
  * Registration cost is $119
  * Discussion about virtual attendance still in progress, might be free but only be advertised/opened for registration a while after in-person registration to encourage more people to come in person
  
  ***ACTION*** Mark Novak (and Richard Searle) from EUAC, requested to talk to Raluca for support and advertising to end users, such as advertising at EUAC event in February
  
   * Have a program committee to evaluate presentation proposals (includes some CCC folks from Outreach already), more welcome
   * Alec Fernandez asked about relationship to OC3
     * Raluca explained that OC3 is online and this is in-person
     * CCS is targeting having 50% users attending, and is not limited to open source (also includes research, real deployments, etc.) whereas OC3 is for open source
     * Also sufficiently spaced on the calendar that they are complementary
  * Raluca suggested CCC member companies could help advertise the event even if they don't sponsor it
  * Web site will go live second week of January, and will start accepting submissions then
  * Program committee will be fixed by early February (5-8 submissions per reviewer probably)
  * Deadline for sponsorship by January (contract, not deadline for money) so can list on website, could be added as late as April but won't have as much visibility in earlier advertisements
  * CCC would have a large table and a project panel presentation, still in the planning stages
  * Co-located with Data+AI Summit https://www.databricks.com/dataaisummit/
  * Raluca's emails: raluca.popa@berkeley.edu and raluca@opaque.co
