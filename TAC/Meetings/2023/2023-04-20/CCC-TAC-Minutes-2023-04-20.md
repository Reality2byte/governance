**Meeting Minute Approval**

Proposed: That the minutes of the April 6, 2023 meeting of the Technical Advisory Council of the Confidential Computing Consortium as distributed to the members of the TAC in advance of this meeting are hereby adopted and approved.

* Quorum was reached and the minutes were approved by the voting members of the TAC. Several changes were made to the minutes during the meeting, and after discussion around the use of presentations that are not yet public, the minutes were approved.

**Action Item Review**

* DM reviewed the current state of the action items


**2023 Goals**

* DM addressed 2023 [plans](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BLsI0hv9ybHl-FBNqHp6bJzy6ng8yKs__556bTqBswc/edit)
* Project Progression - [PR #160](https://github.com/confidential-computing/governance/pull/160)
* Cross Project coordination
  * Lily Sturmann (LS) presented the coordination goals
    * Cross project integration - LS proposed broadening of the goal description to: adding module maintained by another CCC project, or 2 upstream projects being used or contributed to by more than one project
      * Needs further discussion - Dave Thaler (DT) proposed the following change to the definition "There exists at least 2 projects (CCC maintained or not) that have more than one CCC project consuming them."
    * Need to figure out how this should be tracked, maybe have projects self-report, investigate common dependencies
    * DT suggested that his proposed wording may not be sufficient
    * The module integration dependency types were recorded in the goal document
    * DT Suggested: During yearly project review ask projects about upstream contributions, i.e. have you influenced an upstream in a way that potentially benefits other CCC projects. 
    * LS asked if the CCC needs a common project slack channel to discuss these sorts of things
    * To improve communication, proposed cross project integration meetup or virtual event, possible at Confidential Computing Summit
    * KT brought up the possibility of at CCS of setting up regular project maintainer meetings, Lily to follow up with the EUAC and Outreach chairs for event presence


**Project Website funding**
* KT updated funding possibilities from the actual approved budget
* Proposals to include the funding as a part of a benefit of the next stage, Sandbox moving to Incubation stage
* Current line item (use the Test infra for another purpose) or additional ask above the 277K, for example 20K one time per project
* DT proposed 10K (IT Services - website) + 8.5K (from per project Test Infrastructure) - if Board approved, would be tied to the project moving to incubation statge, document in [PR #160](https://github.com/confidential-computing/governance/pull/160)

  ***ACTION*** Dan to take forward a proposal to the Governing Board for website funding above 10K to come from the Test Infrastructure budget
  
  ***ACTION*** Dan to propose addition to Incubation status to cover one-time website or similar benefits


* Next meeting May 4th, 2023
  * DM discussed presentations for the next several meetings


Meeting adjourned at 8:28 am PT
