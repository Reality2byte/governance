* DT mentioned that Chris Ramming’s write up (https://lists.confidentialcomputing.io/g/tac/message/1147) is an excellent basis to respond with.
* Chris Ramming mentioned that IAB’s opinion doesn’t reflect the internet community’s sentiment. This is a good opportunity to educate the internet community about the benefits and opportunities of confidential computing.
* DM suggested this conversation to continue at the next Attestation meeting.
